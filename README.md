# Account System

Welcome to the Account System Backend! This repository contains the backend for a full-stack account management system. Currently, only the backend is availableâ€”with the frontend coming soon.

## Overview

This project is built with Django and is designed to demonstrate:
- **Dockerization:** Run the backend easily with Docker.
- **Database Integration:** A robust account system backed by a PostgreSQL database (with SQLite for testing).
- **Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests using Pytest.
- **Modern Dependency Management:** Managed with Poetry.

The backend features user account management, user profiles, and follow relationships between accounts.

## Technologies Used

- **Django:** The primary web framework.
- **Django REST Framework:** For building a RESTful API.
- **PostgreSQL / SQLite:** For database storage (PostgreSQL in production; SQLite for testing).
- **Docker & Docker Compose:** For containerization and deployment.
- **Poetry:** For dependency management.
- **Pytest:** For unit testing.
